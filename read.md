    /* background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover; */
    bakcground-attachment: fixed;

## short cut
 -short cut for repeat ,position,size
 url() center/cover no-repeat fixed

 ## fixed => don't scroll along the page 
 ## position-> center the image
 ## repeat -> set image to no reapeat
 ## size: cover-> sclae the background image as large as possible

 -----------some times the mobile **phones** not going to support position:fixed = make sure that property

 ## outline offset => the spanning of space in x direction and y direction

 # /* make skill icon in display block because it span is  an inline so if u want to add margin-bottom (give: diplay: block) */

 
 ## even though you give text-align center ,if you we give the max-width for paragraph it take the space as we given to make it center by margin;

 ### and also we have the properties 

.skill:hover .skill-icon
{
    ## this tells if you hover the skill. what should happen the skill-icon

}

#### in the article we can do the descendant selector
### we use skill-title class but not use it 


## BY APPROACH
Section as my main parent -> DIV for my columns -> Articles for my items -> (whatever inside  each item)

## why we put image width is 100%; 
we know the widht of div is defaultly 100% 
so if you put img is 100% it cover the div


### steps
1. set the global variables
2. reset page
3. reset body 

### take section as main parent
## when your project goes from one state to another state we change font-size ,line-height ,width

# Note
In most cases, headings are just 1-3 lines of text. We checked many references and made several mocks to check how it looks and found that smaller line-height (1.35) for headings works better. Because heading fonts are much bigger and line-height of 150% creates extra whitespace that makes it too spread apart.

## in the skills we dont give any margin which measn we don't need separate the element


### section(main-parent) => div-center(as column)
